=== MAIN MENU ===
Wrap user input checks in function instead of clogging event list
Dropdown next to Input to show top100 workshop enabled games
- Find data for it
- Make the input a fuzzy search instead of a dropdown ?
=================


=== INPUT MENU ===
Support Import / Export input.txt ?
====================



=== DOWNLOAD MENU ===
Find a way to show progress (maybe run the downloading as a subprocess and update a progress bar ?)
=====================


=== META ===
Find better screen enabling/disabling method (dictionnary id:keyword with for loop to enable/disable all but new screen ?)
- toggleMenu(layout_key) function which disables all but the passed layout
Rename all events so they have a more clear and unique name to avoid overlap (BACK1, BACK2 etc is a problem)
Find a good icon
Support steam collections
More safety checks and input sanitization between each menu
Convert to .exe file for easier installation / usage
